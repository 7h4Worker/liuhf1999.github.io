We benchmarked binocular SSVEP stimuli inside immersive VR environments, revealing that stereo-dependent target design meaningfully influences information transfer rate, error rate, and participant comfort. The study provides implementation guidelines for VR-BCI paradigms where depth cues and binocular fusion are critical.
