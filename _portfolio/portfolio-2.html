<p>This Unity-driven AR/VR platform enables multiple participants to co-control robots and vehicles using SSVEP-based brain signals. The system synchronizes shared targets, renders depth-stable cues, and combines live cognitive state feedback with physical device telemetry.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Wearable ear-EEG and forehead EEG sensors with low-latency wireless streaming.</li>
	<li><strong>Software:</strong> Unity scenes orchestrating collaborative tasks, car and robotic arm control, and AR overlays.</li>
	<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Demonstrations used in competition finals and lab outreach to communicate practical BCI applications.</li>
</ul>
