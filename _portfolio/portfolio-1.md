This project integrates VR-rendered SSVEP targets with a quadrotor control stack, allowing pilots to steer and adjust altitude using only brain responses.

- **Focus:** Rapid target selection workflow optimized for immersive displays.
- **Role:** Led Unity scene design, signal processing pipeline, and ROS bridge to the drone autopilot.
- **Outcome:** Demonstrated stable outdoor flight at university demos and inspired competition entries.
