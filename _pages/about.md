I am a Ph.D. candidate at ShanghaiTech University exploring how VR/AR visual paradigms, wearable EEG hardware, and neural decoding co-design next-generation brain–computer interfaces. My recent work delivers binocular SSVEP paradigms that encode more targets with fewer frequencies, Unity-based multi-scene BCI platforms, and scalable FPGA-powered acquisition hardware. I aim to build perception-compute fused personal BCI systems and the broader brain-internet infrastructure around them.

## Research Interests
- Binocular and VR-oriented SSVEP paradigms for immersive BCIs
- Wearable EEG/EXG systems, ultraflexible electrodes, and multimodal sensing
- Edge intelligence for real-time neural decoding and closed-loop interaction

## Selected Highlights
- Developed VR dual-view SSVEP frameworks that enhance robustness and user comfort with minimal frequency sets.
- Built wireless and FPGA-based EEG acquisition systems supporting laboratory and remote deployment scenarios.
- Co-authored articles in *Frontiers in Neuroscience*, IEEE EMBC, *Moore and More*, and *Exploration*, with a 2025 IEEE JBHI paper accepted.
- Contributed to two national invention patents covering SSVEP paradigm generation and AR-based brain feedback systems.

## 中文简介
我来自上海科技大学—中科院联合培养博士项目，长期聚焦于 VR 场景下的 SSVEP 范式、可穿戴脑电硬件与边缘智能解码。在立体视觉脑机接口的研究中，我提出了低频组双目编码策略，搭建多场景 Unity EEG-BCI 平台，并开发可穿戴/FPGA 脑电采集系统，致力于实现感知—算力融合的个人脑机接口平台与脑联网体系。

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
