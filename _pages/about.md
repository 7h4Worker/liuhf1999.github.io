I am a Ph.D. candidate at ShanghaiTech University studying brain–computer interfaces for extended-reality interaction. My work centers on binocular SSVEP paradigms for immersive VR/AR environments, Unity-based multi-scene EEG-BCI platforms, and wearable EEG devices tailored for everyday use. I am interested in how perception design, neural decoding, and system engineering come together to deliver practical noninvasive BCIs.

## Research Interests
- VR/AR binocular SSVEP paradigms for noninvasive BCI control
- Unity-based multi-scene EEG-BCI experimental platforms
- Wearable EEG / ear-EEG prototypes and daily-life BCI applications

## Selected Highlights
- Proposed binocular SSVEP encoding schemes that enable few-frequency, multi-target interfaces in immersive VR settings.
- Built Unity-driven cross-scene BCI frameworks and ear/band EEG prototypes for mobile interaction.
- Developed multi-user brain-networking demos combining AR displays with collaborative BCI control.
- Led teams that won bronze in the 2025 China BCI Competition (brain-controlled car and robotic arm events).
